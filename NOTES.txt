- Horizontal pod autoscaling does not apply to objects that can't be scaled (for example: a DaemonSet.)
- It is not possible to directly specify the name of the namespaces in a NetworkPolicy. You must use a namespaceSelector with matchLabels or matchExpressions to select the namespaces based on their labels.
